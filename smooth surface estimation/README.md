# census-tract-redistricting

This repo is dedicated to each one of the individual scripts that will represent different processes for census tract  
walkthroughs/conversions. 

In the US, the Census Bureau re-draws districts every 10 years. 

## estimate smooth surface
In this project, we attempt to estimate a near-smooth surface of population data in order to interpolate data between years of census tract data. We then use this interpolation process to create a table that can be used to map any dataset between years of census tracts.
